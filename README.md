## Blackjack
This project was used as a self assessment after attending 7 weeks of coding bootcamp in which we were given a week to make a project of our choosing. The project lets you play a game of blackjack against the computer dealer to your heart's content. While a simple game to understand in theory, it is quite a challenge to win consistently. Test your blackjack skills here!
